## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Information

The main project requirements for this were:
    1.  Dynamically build a menu based on the content on the page
    2.  Identify the currently active section by styling it differently
    3.  Scroll to sections from the dynamically created menu

In addition to the requirements, I also added these features:
    1.  Hide the fixed menu when not at the top of the page
    2.  Show the fixed menu bar whenever scrolling
    3.  Identify the menu item that refers tot he currently active section

I also added a css transition on the menu so that it slides up/down when showing or hiding.
